RouteSomethingOrAnother, for routing Pokemon GBA/DS games
Not anywhere near a usable state yet.

For earlier games:
RouteOne is available from: https://github.com/HRoll/poke-router
RouteTwo is available from: https://github.com/Dabomstew/pokemon-routetwo

README

To use RouteThree, execute the .jar file with a proper config.ini file. 

To run this, you will need Java 7 (http://www.java.com/en/download/win8.jsp?locale=en).

Make sure you have a proper route file whose filename is given under the 
appropriate option in the config file. To read your output, simply open the text
file whose filename you specified in the config file.

Also, when reading your output, be sure to check the top of the file. Any error 
messages will be displayed there (the lines with errors are simply ignored, and 
this may cause you to miss important lines).

For more detailed instructions, see doc.txt. [NOTE: No documentation in the 
alpha-version. Kappa.]
